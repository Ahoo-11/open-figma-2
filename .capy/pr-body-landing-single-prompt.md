## Summary

This PR adds a public landing page at `/`, moves the dashboard to `/dashboard`, simplifies AI design generation to a single prompt, and improves SPA navigation and UX polish in key areas.

### Changes
- Routing
  - `/` → new `LandingPage` (dark hero with two CTAs)
  - `/dashboard` → existing `ProjectList`
  - `/design/:designId` unchanged
  - Unknown routes redirect to `/` (simple NotFound route available)
- Landing Page
  - New `frontend/components/LandingPage.tsx`
  - CTAs: "Open Dashboard" and "Generate from Prompt" (routes to dashboard and programmatically opens AI prompt)
- AI Design Dialog
  - `AIDesignDialog.tsx` simplified to a single required `prompt` input
  - Calls `backend.ai.generateDesign({ prompt })` with loading/disabled/error toasts
- Navigation & Header
  - Removed any full page reloads; replaced with React Router navigation
  - Header brand links to `/` (landing)
  - Visible "Dashboard" CTA to `/dashboard`
  - "New Design" button triggers AI prompt on the dashboard
- Dashboard (ProjectList)
  - SPA navigation for new file and file open
  - Empty state includes a CTA: "Generate from Prompt"
  - Programmatic AI prompt open via `location.state.openAIDialog`
  - On successful AI generation, navigate to `/design/:id`
  - Loading state retained; toasts for errors
- Create File Dialog
  - Adds `startWithAI` prop to open AI dialog immediately (used by landing + header flows)
- Theming & Config
  - Default dark mode by setting `class="dark"` on html
  - API base URL prefers `VITE_API_URL`, falling back to existing `VITE_CLIENT_TARGET` or `Local`

### Why
- Make the product approachable for first-time users with a clear landing page
- Reduce friction by simplifying AI generation to a single prompt
- Ensure SPA-only navigation for better performance and UX
- Provide quick wins on dashboard empty/loading states

### Impact
- No breaking backend changes; frontend now sends `{ prompt }` to generate designs
- Environment compatibility: if you already use `VITE_CLIENT_TARGET`, it still works; `VITE_API_URL` can be set explicitly
- Dark mode is now default; aligns with existing styles and components

### Acceptance Criteria mapping
- Visiting `/` shows the new LandingPage in dark mode with the two CTAs
- "Open Dashboard" → routes to `/dashboard` and shows `ProjectList`
- "Generate from Prompt" → routes to `/dashboard` and auto-opens the AI prompt dialog
- AI dialog displays only one text input for prompt; submitting generates and navigates to `/design/:id`
- All navigations are SPA (no `window.location`)
- Header brand to `/`, visible "Dashboard" link, and a "New Design" action that opens the AI prompt
- Dashboard empty state includes a CTA to open the prompt dialog; loading/error states present

### Testing Notes
- Typechecked successfully (tsc)
- Verified SPA navigation, state-driven AI dialog open, and success navigation to design routes
- Backend calls rely on existing Encore client; mock data remains for list views if backend is unavailable

### Screens/Files
- `frontend/App.tsx` (routing)
- `frontend/components/LandingPage.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/components/Header.tsx`
- `frontend/components/AIDesignDialog.tsx`
- `frontend/components/CreateFileDialog.tsx`
- `frontend/components/ProjectList.tsx`
- `frontend/index.html` (dark mode default)
- `frontend/client.ts` (VITE_API_URL support)
